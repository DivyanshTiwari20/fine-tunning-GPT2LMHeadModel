# GPT-2 Fine-tuning on ConvoAI Dataset

## Description
This repository contains code for fine-tuning a GPT-2 LM head model from Hugging Face on the ConvoAI dataset. The project includes both a Google Colab notebook and Python scripts for local execution.

## Contents
- Google Colab notebook for cloud-based execution
- Python scripts for local execution
- Requirements and setup instructions for both environments

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- Transformers library from Hugging Face
- ConvoAI dataset (instructions for downloading included in the code)

## Installation and Setup

### Local PC Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DivyanshTiwari20/fine-tunning-GPT2LMHeadModel.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install torch transformers datasets numpy pandas tqdm
   ```

### Google Colab Setup
1. Open the provided `.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Run the following cell to install necessary packages:
   ```python
   !pip install torch
   !pip install transformers
   !pip install datasets
   !pip install numpy
   !pip install pandas
   !pip install tqdm
   ```

## Usage

### Local PC
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the main Python script:
   ```
   python fine_tune_gpt2.py
   ```

### Google Colab
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook.
3. Run each cell sequentially.

## Important Packages
Make sure you have the following packages installed:
- `torch`
- `transformers`
- `datasets`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `tqdm`

To install these packages, you can use the following commands:

```python
pip install torch
pip install transformers
pip install datasets
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install tqdm
```

These packages are crucial for running the fine-tuning process, whether on a local PC or Google Colab.

## Tutorial

## Model Details
- Base Model: GPT-2 LM head from Hugging Face
- Dataset: ConvoAI
- Fine-tuning Process: The model is fine-tuned on conversational data to improve its performance in dialogue generation tasks.

## Results
(Add information about the performance of your fine-tuned model, any benchmarks, or sample outputs)

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the fine-tuning process or extend the project are welcome. Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests.
